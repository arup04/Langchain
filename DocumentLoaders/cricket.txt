The sun burns bright upon the pitch so green,
A battle waged where champions are seen.
The bowler charges, fierce and keen,
The batsman stands—a stoic machine.

The ball takes flight, a whistling sound,
A moment’s hush, then cheers abound.
It soars beyond the fielder’s bound,
Six runs! The crowd leaps from the ground.

The spinners weave their crafty art,
With guile and turn, they play their part.
The batter’s feet, so light, so smart,
Dance down to strike—pure poetry in heart.

The keeper crouches, sharp and sly,
The stumps erupt—a desperate cry!
The umpire’s finger climbs the sky,
Out! The field erupts, "Howzzat?!" rings high.

From tense defense to bold attack,
Each run, each wicket, pulls us back.
A game where time itself seems slack,
Till last ball falls—the final crack.

Oh, cricket! Drama, sweat, and grace,
A timeless duel at measured pace.
In every clash, in every chase,
Lies glory no other sport can replace.
